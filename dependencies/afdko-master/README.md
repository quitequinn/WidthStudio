Adobe Font Development Kit for OpenType
=======================================

A set of tools for building OpenType font files from PostScript and TrueType font data.

This directory tree contains the data files, Python script, Perl scripts, and
sources for the command line programs that comprise the AFDKO.

Please refer to the file "AFDKO-Overview.html" for a more detailed description
of what is in the AFDKO.

The file "FDK Build Notes.txt" explains how to assemble a working version of the
AFDKO. Note that batteries are NOT included: you will need to configure a Python
interpreter to work with the AFDKO, and build the command-line tools from the
sources. The "FDK Build Notes.txt" file explains how to do this.

The file "Read_Me_First.html" explains how to install a copy of the AFDKO, once
you have assembled a working version.

You can also download and install a working version from:
   http://www.adobe.com/devnet/opentype/afdko.html.
This download contains two command-line programs, IS and checkOutlines, that are
not in the OpenSource branch of the AFDKO.
